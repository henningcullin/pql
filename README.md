# PQL

A sqlx inspired library for php. It is made for extremely ease of use with sqlite and php.

## Setup

I am not quite sure of what exactly you need to do. But here is what I do to enable the SQLite3 extension in php:

#### Make sure the following are in your php.ini file:

extension=pdo_sqlite
extension=sqlite3
extension=php_pdo.dll
extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll

#### Make sure you do the following:

Add the '(XAMPDIR)\php\ext' directory to your PATH ENV.
